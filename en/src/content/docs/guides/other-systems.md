In addition to openFyde, the XpressReal supports other operating systems, such as Linux and Android. 
You can download the OS images from our [Resource Download](/reference/resource-download) page to 
experiment with different systems.

## Third party system images

Our Linux OS images are built with the Yocto Project. Use `balenaEtcher` to flash a downloaded image to a microSD card, then boot your XpressReal from it.
Refer to the [Getting Started Guide](/guide/getting-started) for flashing instructions.

## Android
